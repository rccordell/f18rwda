description: What might digital writing *be*?

Shortly after the serialization of ["17776"][1] was fully published on SBNation, author Jon Bois posted [a Q&A about the story][2] in which he responded to readers' questions. One of these questions, along with Bois' answer, seems particularly pertinent to our course discussions:

> Do you think weird experimental stories like this have a future in sports writing or was this a singular event?  
> - @Crazyeyesdave
> 
> I hope so. Maybe not distant-future sports sci-fi, but that’s only one of a thousand lanes.
> 
> I could go really, really long on this answer. I’ll keep it short: There are countless different ways to write, and things and ideas to write about. And the Internet offers a kaleidoscope of different formats, media, tools, sights, and sounds to tell your stories. And most of us are not even trying to scrape the surface of any of it. We’ve got to start thinking of the Internet as something more than a glow-in-the-dark newspaper.

Thanks @Crazyeyesdave! 

Take a few minutes to reflect on this question and Bois' answer in light of your reading of "17776" for today's class. Did the story help you think in new ways about online writing, whether sports writing, journalism, or fiction? Would you want to see more experimental writing like this, or not? What works in this story and what doesn't, and what (if anything) do you think it might help us consider about where reading and writing are heading in the next few (or 15,000) years?
