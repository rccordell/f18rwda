## Getting to Know Each Other

In order to get our semester started, I'd like you each to share a bit of information about yourselves and respond to a short writing prompt. We'll discuss these together. 

BTW: I also wrote this post so there would be something in the "Updates" section of the course website as we talk about the syllabus today!

So, first tell us:

+ Your name and any preferred nicknames
	+ Your pronouns
	+ Your year at Northeastern
	+ Your major(s), minor(s), or concentration(s)
	+ Your favorite meme right now (and be prepared to share it and talk about why you like it)

## Writing prompt

Next, I'd like you to reflect briefly on these questions:

How have reading & writing practices shifted just during your lifetime? Do you think these changes are significant? How so or why not?
