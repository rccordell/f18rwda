# In-class Activity: Attending to the Web

The pieces we read for today share a few ideas, namely:

1. That the media we consume shape our habits and attention
2. That the web works on our attention in specific ways that are, perhaps, unique compared to previous media
3. That we have trouble fully apprehending these changes from within the system that fostered them

Today, then, I'd like you to think about the way some of your favorite websites operate within the web's "attention economy." What kinds of attention do these sites ask from and/or cultivate in visitors? How do these sites reward particular kinds of engagement, and how do these rewards play into what we know about the science of attention? Who stands to benefitâ€”visitors/readers, advertisers, writers, or someone else?
