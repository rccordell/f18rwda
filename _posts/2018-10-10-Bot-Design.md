title: Blueprinting a Bot
description: 'What would you program/write to make the web slightly more interesting?'

You don't need to be a programmer to imagine how you might create—or *write*?—a bot for Twitter or another web platform. Essentially, a bot requires these things:

1. **Source data**. Where will your bot get its source material? It could could from pre-written text(s), other social media feeds, other website(s), open governmental data—and there are far more possibilities. Some bots work with a single data source, others combine multiple data sources for absurd, profound, or absurdly profound results. 
2. **A principle of selection**. What precisely is your bot looking for in its source data? Does it work with every data point from its source, or only those that meet particular conditions? 
3. **A transformation**. What will your bot do with its source data? Will it alter the source data somehow? Will it mash up multiple data sources? What kinds of structures (linguistic, formal, technical) will it need to use to make these transformations? 
4. **Output**. What should the final product look like? What will happen to it? Does it get posted to social media? Added to a website? Displayed on a monitor somewhere? Twitter bots are perhaps the most famous, but they are far from the only bots in the world today.

Working in groups of 2-3, I'd like you to imagine a bot using the guidelines above.
