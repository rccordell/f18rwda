# Developing a Research Problem

+ Move from topics to questions to problems (to claims)
+ Keep asking questions about relationships and significance
+ Genuine problems have consequences for readers, though perhaps only particular communities of readers

## Tangible Problems

Some problems have tangible, or "real world" consequences for a group of readers. In many ways these are easier to identify as problems for new writers.

### Example for Developing a Tangible Problem

1. Topic: Reading on screens versus reading on paper
2. Question: I want to learn, do readers using screens retain less information than readers using paper media?
3. Consequence: 
4. Potential Application:

## Conceptual Problems

Conceptual problems can be harder for new writers because they are a bit more abstract, and their consequences perhaps seem less…well…consequential, at least in immediate, corporal ways. But conceptual problems should have consequences for readers, at least readers from communities or disciplines for whom understanding your topic well is a priority. 

### Example for Developing a Conceptual Problem

1. Topic: depictions of geography in "17776"
2. Question: I want to learn whether there is a relationship between depictions of geography in "17776" and the story's depictions of human (or non-human) relationships
3. Consequences:
4. Potential Applications:
