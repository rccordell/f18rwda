1. Divide into groups
2. Assign each group 1 voice from the book (Babybot, Stephen Chinn, Mary3, Gaby, Karl Dettman, Alan Turing, Mary Bradford)
3. Outline everything you can about your character, including:

	+ When do they exist?
	+ How would you describe them (physically, emotionally, tonally, etc.)?
	+ How does this character relate to each of the other voices in the novel? 
	+ Why do you think this character is important/necessary to the novel?
