# Grade Contracts

In this course, you will determine the grade you receive by fulfilling a contract we will agree to on the third day of class. Your contract will detail the requirements you will meet in order to receive the grade for which you've contracted, as well as the penalties you will incur for not meeting those requirements.

## Why Contract Grading? 

As you no doubt know, grading can be a contentious issue in college courses, particularly in writing- and discussion-based courses, where grades can seem arbitrary and contestable. Grading in school does not much resemble the way you will be evaluated in your lives or careers, where you will define many of your own goals and be measured by how responsibly and effectively you achieve them. To quote Cathy Davidson, a professor at CUNY from whom most of my ideas about contract grading are adapted:

> The advantage of contract grading is that you, the student, decide how much work you wish to do this semester; if you complete that work on time and satisfactorily, you will receive the grade for which you contracted. This means planning ahead, thinking about all of your obligations and responsibilities this semester and also determining what grade you want or need in this course. The advantage of contract grading to the professor is no whining, no special pleading, on the students part. If you complete the work you contracted for, you get the grade. Done. I respect the student who only needs a C, who has other obligations that preclude doing all of the requirements to earn an A in the course, and who contracts for the C and carries out the contract perfectly. (This is another one of those major life skills: taking responsibility for your own workflow.)

## Contract Details

To complete **any** of these contracts a student must:

1. Come to class prepared to discuss any assigned readings, games, videos, or other media. Participate actively in class discussions, making observations and asking questions that help the class think together. 
2. Complete a self-assessment demonstrating that your work has met the agreed requirements, submitting it to Professor Cordell by 5pm on Tuesday, December 11.

### "A" Contract

To contract for an "A" in this course, you agree to:

1. Earn "Satisfactory" on all in-class assignments save three, meaning you could miss up to three classes, earn "Unsatisfactory" on up to three in-class assignments, or some combination of these two conditions, so long as no more than three in-class assignments are marked "Unsatisfactory." 
2. Take no more than one information overload day during the semester. 
3. Create a website following all requirements of the "A Domain of Your Own" assignment. 
4. Write at least 10 "Satisfactory" weekly blog entries over the course of the semester. As specified in the blogging assignment, you may not complete two blog posts for credit in the same week, and you cannot make up missed blog entries at the end of the semester.
5. Complete all writing assignments to the requirements of each and by their specified due dates. Revise each writing assignment until you and your instructor agree it is "Satisfactory." 

### "B" Contract

To contract for an "B" in this course, you agree to:

1. Earn "Satisfactory" on all in-class assignments save four, meaning you could miss up to four classes, earn "Unsatisfactory" on up to four in-class assignments, or some combination of these two conditions, so long as no more than four in-class assignments are marked "Unsatisfactory." 
2. Take no more than two information overload days during the semester. 
3. Create a website following most requirements of the "A Domain of Your Own" assignment, though you might opt to use an "out of the box" website solution.
4. Write at least 8 "Satisfactory" weekly blog entries over the course of the semester. As specified in the blogging assignment, you may not complete two blog posts for credit in the same week, and you cannot make up missed blog entries at the end of the semester.
5. Complete all writing assignments to the requirements of each and by their specified due dates. Revise at least four of these assignments until you and your instructor agree they are "Satisfactory." 

### "C" Contract

To contract for an "C" in this course, you agree to:

1. Earn "Satisfactory" on all in-class assignments save five, meaning you could miss up to five classes, earn "Unsatisfactory" on up to five in-class assignments, or some combination of these two conditions, so long as no more than five in-class assignments are marked "Unsatisfactory." 
2. Take no more than two information overload days during the semester. 
3. Create a website following most requirements of the "A Domain of Your Own" assignment, though you might opt to use an "out of the box" website solution.
4. Write at least 6 "Satisfactory" weekly blog entries over the course of the semester. As specified in the blogging assignment, you may not complete two blog posts for credit in the same week, and you cannot make up missed blog entries at the end of the semester.
5. Complete 4/5 writing assignments to their requirements and by their specified due dates. Revise at least three of these assignments until you and your instructor agree it is "Satisfactory." 

## "D" and "F" Grades

I've borrowed this clause, too, from Cathy Davidson, because I cannot improve upon it:

> The professor reserves the right to award a grade of D or F to anyone who fails to meet a contractual obligation in a systematic way. A "D" grade denotes some minimal fulfilling of the contract. An "F" is absence of enough satisfactory work, as contracted, to warrant passing of the course. Both a "D" and "F" denote a breakdown of the contractual relationship implied by signing any of the contracts described above.

## What About Exceptional Work?

I do reserve the right to reward exceptional work throughout the semester using the full range of Northeastern's grading scale. If you contract for a "B," for instance, and submit particularly strong pieces to fulfill that contract, I may elect to raise your contracted grade to a "B+."

## Contract Adjustments

Periodically during the semester I will ask you to evaluate your work thus far and compare it against what you agreed in your grade contract. In these moments you can also take the opportunity to request an adjustment to your contract in either direction. If you find that you will be unable to meet the obligations of your contract, you may request to move to the next lowest grade and its requirements. Contrariwise, if you find that you've been performing above the obligations of your contract, you may request to fulfill the requirements for the next higher grade.
