Reading and Writing in the Digital Age - Fall 2018  
Argument/Wikipedia Workshop

# Exercise A: Argument Workshop

During this workshop, you should keep this paper in hand. **Do not hand it to your partner to fill out.** Instead, you should ask these questions, hear their answers, and then summarize their answers in your own words on the sheet.

1. What would you identify as my central claim?
2. Is my claim debatable? Can you articulate a reasonable counterclaim?
3. Is my claim specific enough? Is it something I could prove in the length of this document?
4. What would you identify as 3-4 specific reasons or subclaims?
5. Do my reasons clearly support my claim? Do they appear in a logical order?
6. Does my evidence support my reasons (and thus my claim)? 
7. Does my evidence come from reliable and authoritative sources? Which sources should I reconsider?
8. What additional evidence do I need to provide?
9. Do I effectively acknowledge counter claims? Are my responses adequate?

# Exercise B: Wikipedia Workshop

Wikipedia articles should not be making arguments; they belong to a distinct genre of writing. So the questions you should ask your reviewer should be different. As above, though, you should ask these questions and synthesize their answers in your own words. 

1. How well do the sections I have written for this article (or my starter article) help you understand my topic? What do you feel you still do not understand after reading this article?
2. Have I included enough evidence to support the sections I have drafted? Is the evidence reliable and authoritative?
3. What other kinds of evidence should I look for to substantiate my descriptions?
4. Do my style and tone match the expectations for Wikipedia articles? What should I edit to make the article read more like an encyclopedia article and less like an academic paper or other genre?
5. How well does my prose integrate with any existing prose in this article? Can you suggest ways I could tailor my writing (or edit previous writing) to ensure that the article reads as a single composition?
6. (If applicable) How might I respond to the concerns raised by other Wikipedia editors?
