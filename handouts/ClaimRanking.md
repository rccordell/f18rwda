1. "17776" imagines a future in which no one ever dies and thus life has become stagnant.
2. The entire premise of "17776" is absurd; the technologies it describes will never come to pass.
3. The satellites in "17776" stand in for the reader, asking questions and explaining how the world of the story came to be.
4. "17776" is narrated by satellites who only see the earth through maps, satellite images, and media artifacts, highlighting through their distant view the isolation and loneliness of the immortal people populating earth in the story.
5. I will analyze various chapters of "17776" to demonstrate the ways the story represents technology and its effects.

7. Despite its subtitle, "What Football Will Look Like in the Future," Jon Bois' "17776" is not so much about sports as it is about the ways humans create meaning for their lives through creativity and play.
8. Bois would not be able to tell the story of "17776" without the medium of the internet.
9. "17776" links technological and social ambition with cycles of birth and death, implying that human ideas of progress are closely linked to our sense of mortality.
10. The videos in "17776" are incredibly annoying, forcing readers to sit through scrolling text they could read much faster in another form.
