# The Nitty-Gritty

This assignment asks you to complete a typical academic essay of 5-6 pages. In the first weeks of class we will discuss the expectations for such a paper, brainstorm essay topics, and outline the elements of effective academic argument. You should expect to:

1. Make a specific, debatable claim;
2. Defend that claim with reasons and evidence drawn from at least four sources, at least two of which we did not read in class;
3. Acknowledge contrasting points of view and respond to them.

You may use whatever citation system you wish (MLA, APA, Chicago) but you must cite your sources and do so consistently.


# What to Write About

You will develop your own essay topics, though they should be related to our themes in class: e.g. digital and analog modes of reading, artificial intelligence, etc. From that broad mandate, however, you should choose a specific aspect of such themes that you find interesting and conduct additional research into it. You might choose to write a literary analysis of 1-2 of the short stories we've read in class, for instance, or to take a side on a "real world" debate. Ideally, your paper will extend our class discussion into territory we did not cover in class itself. 

For a paper to be considered satisfactory, your essay should be critical rather than descriptive. Your central claim (or thesis) must be debatable, meaning a reasonable person could in fact disagree with it. You will conduct research and defend your claim with evidence drawn from *at least four distinct sources*, two of which much come from your own research rather than materials we read as a class. We will discuss all of these elements of argument in class and during our writing workshops. 

If you are struggling to come up with a topic or craft an argument, please come see me during office hours to discuss. Whether you are struggling or not, [schedule an appointment with the writing center][3], where they are happy to help with writing at any stage in the process.
