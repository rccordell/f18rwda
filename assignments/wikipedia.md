# The Nitty-Gritty

In this assignment you will work either individually or in pairs to create a new Wikipedia article or upgrade a [Wikipedia stub]()(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Stub). Your article should at least reach start class (though B is a good reach goal). You should use the [WikiProject Assessment guidelines]()(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_assessment) to shape your process and you can refer to Wikipedia's [training page for students]()(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_students). You could use the page for the [Boston Society of Vulcans]()(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Society_of_Vulcans) as a model for what you should write to fulfil the assignment.

We will be working with Amanda Rust (Digital Humanities Librarian) and Evie Cordell (Undergraduate Engagement/First Year Experience Librarian) from Snell Library to learn what those categories mean, and how you can write an article that meets these expectations. 

You will submit a link to your final article by the date specified in your grade contract. If you are improving an existing article, you should also include a link to the article's state immediately before you began your work for comparison.
